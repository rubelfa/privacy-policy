    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 18/10/2024</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing to use our mobile applications. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use any of our mobile applications ("Apps").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Personal information such as your name, email address, or payment information may be collected when you voluntarily provide it through account creation, subscription, or in-app purchases. This information is used to personalize your experience and manage your account.</p>

    <h3>b. Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect non-personal information, including but not limited to device type, operating system, usage data, and app performance data. This information helps us improve our Apps and optimize your experience.</p>

    <h3>c. Location Data</h3>
    <p>Some of our Apps may collect location data to provide location-based services or for analytics purposes. You can enable or disable location services at any time through your device settings.</p>

    <h3>d. Financial Data</h3>
    <p>For apps with financial features (like budget management or transaction tracking), we may collect transaction data such as category, amount, and payment methods. This data is used only within the app and stored securely.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Improve the Apps:</strong> We use data to deliver app functionalities, resolve technical issues, and optimize your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To customize your app experience, including showing relevant content or features.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send alerts for features like reminders, notifications, or updates you have opted into.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To track usage patterns and improve app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Some of our Apps use third-party advertising networks like Google AdMob to serve ads based on your interactions within the app. You can opt out of personalized ads through your device’s settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our Apps may integrate with third-party services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Networks:</strong> For apps that display ads, we use networks such as Google AdMob, which may collect data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> We use tools like Google Analytics or Firebase to understand app usage and improve the app experience.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> For apps with in-app purchases, we work with payment gateways (e.g., Google Play) to securely process payments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third-party services may have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the app’s services or comply with legal obligations. Non-personal data may be retained for analytical purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can view and update your account information within the app settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt-out of receiving notifications or ads by adjusting your device or app settings.</li>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>If you are accessing our Apps from outside the country where our servers are located, please note that your information may be transferred, stored, and processed in that country. By using our Apps, you consent to such transfer and processing.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. The updated policy will be posted within the app and will indicate the "Last Updated" date.</p>
